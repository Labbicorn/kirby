# Kirby: A Social RSS Platform

## Introduction

Kirby is a platform designed to revolutionize the way we interact with RSS feeds. At its core, it provides functionality for sharing and subscribing to RSS OPML files, opening up a new realm of content discovery. With a vision of becoming a comprehensive RSS reader and social platform, Kirby is stepping towards integrating blockchain technology, intelligent content summarization, and smart notifications.

## Features

- **OPML Sharing and Subscribing**: Any user can upload their RSS OPML files, share with others, and subscribe to other users' shared feeds.
- **Integrated RSS Reader**: An in-built reader to directly engage with the content from subscribed RSS feeds.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Future support for Solana's message distribution applications, enabling user discussions and interactions.
- **Smart Notifications**: An innovative notification system that pushes updates based on users' interests, keeping information overload at bay.
- **Content Summarization**: Integration with GPT for succinct content summaries, aiding in managing information efficiently.
- **Blockchain Network Agnostic Subscriptions**: Support for subscribing to on-chain data from not only Solana but other blockchain networks through an off-chain information transformer, converting on-chain data to RSS-supported link formats.

Subscribing to others' shared feeds and utilizing the integrated RSS reader to interact with the content enriches the user's information landscape.

### 3. Community Discussion

Engage with a community of like-minded individuals, discussing topics of interest and creating a social fabric around content.

### 4. Blockchain Messaging (Future Feature)

Integration of blockchain-based messaging, initially targeting Solana's message distribution applications, to enable decentralized discussions.

### 5. Content Summarization

Leveraging GPT to provide succinct summaries of RSS content, helping users cope with information overload.

### 6. On-chain to Off-chain Conversion

A transformation utility to convert on-chain data from various blockchain networks to RSS-supported link formats, enabling subscriptions beyond traditional RSS feeds.
